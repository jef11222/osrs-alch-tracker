A real-time, desktop companion tool for **Old School RuneScape (OSRS)** that monitors live Grand Exchange prices via the official OSRS Wiki Real-time Prices API. It tracks high-margin High Alchemy flips, evaluates Craft-then-Alch skilling recipes, manages 4-hour Grand Exchange buy limit timers, tracks Nature Rune bank stockpiles, and logs session profit and Magic XP.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📂 Expandable Ingredient Dropdown Trees in Skilling Guide (v1.3.34):**
  - **Hierarchical Ingredient Tree (`▶` / `▼`):** The Skilling Guide is now an interactive dropdown tree! Click `▶` on any method (such as bar smelting, bows, potions, or jewellery) to expand and reveal its exact raw materials indented underneath (`↳ 1x Iron ore`, `↳ 2x Coal`).
  - **Individual Buy Ceilings for Each Ore & Material:** Each individual ingredient row calculates and displays its own dedicated **`🎯 Max Mat Buy` ceiling** (`target_buy_p`) and breakeven ceiling, telling you the exact ceiling price to pay for each component to maintain your profit margin.
  - **Live Offer & Ask Market Prices:** Ingredient rows display real-time GE Target Offer (Bid), Instant Buy (Ask), total quantity scaled to your goal level, and total batch gold cost.
  - **1-Click Copy on Child Cells:** Click any ingredient's Max Buy price, Bid Offer, Ask, or quantity to instantly copy the exact integer to your clipboard for rapid in-game trading.
  - **➕ Expand All / ➖ Collapse All:** One-click toolbar controls to expand all training methods at once or collapse back to compact rows.
  - **Full Multi-Material Ceilings in Craft & Sell GE:** Secondary ingredients (like Coal, second ores, secondaries) in `💰 Craft & Sell GE` now calculate and display individual best buy ceilings and breakeven values alongside primary materials.

- **🔨 Comprehensive Bar Smelting & Blast Furnace Training (v1.3.33):**
  - **Complete Bar Smelting in Skilling Guide:** Added mathematically exact training brackets for smelting **Bronze, Iron, Silver, Steel, Gold (with Goldsmith Gauntlets), Mithril, Adamantite, and Runite bars** into the Skilling Guide tab.
  - **Blast Furnace vs. Standard Furnace Methods:** Full support for both premier Members Blast Furnace training (halved coal requirements, 110k+ XP/hr, and 1M+ GP/hr profit) and standard Furnace methods (Edgeville/Falador/Lumbridge) for Free-to-Play players.
  - **Family Crest Quest Integration:** Added *Family Crest* to Smithing quest unlocks, highlighting Goldsmith Gauntlets (boosts Gold bar smelting from 22.5 ➔ 56.2 XP ea, unlocking 350k+ XP/hr at Blast Furnace).
  - **Craft & Sell GE Expansion:** Added furnace smelting recipes for Bronze, Silver, Steel, Gold, Mithril, Adamantite, and Runite bars into `💰 Craft & Sell GE`, providing F2P production recipes alongside Blast Furnace.

- **🏷️ Target Sell Price in Craft & Sell GE (v1.3.32):**
  - **Accurate In-Game GE Listing Price:** The sell column now displays the exact **Target Sell Price** you should list the item for on the Grand Exchange (`gross_sell_ea`), rather than the net post-tax amount.
  - **1-Click Copy Listing Price:** Clicking the cell copies the exact gross listing price to your clipboard so you can paste it directly into the in-game GE offer window without accidentally double-taxing your offer.
  - **Transparent Tax Accounting:** The hover tooltip details the full breakdown: Target GE Listing Price, 1% Jagex tax deduction, and Net Revenue received. Net profit and ROI remain 100% tax-accurate.

- **🛡️ Full-Stack Audit, Column Sorting & Clipboard Hardening (v1.3.31):**
  - **Comprehensive Production Stability Audit:** Performed deep audit across all 9 application modules, eliminating potential edge cases, crashes, and index mismatches.
  - **Column Sorting Corrections:** Fixed Treeview column index lookups across both *Craft & Alch* and *Craft & Sell GE* tabs, ensuring multi-direction sorting works flawlessly on every single column without exception.
  - **1-Click Cell Price Copying in Craft & Alch:** Clicking Material Cost, Alch Value, or Profit cells in *Craft & Alch* now copies the exact numerical values directly to the clipboard.
  - **Clipboard Lock Protection:** Hardened `copy_to_clipboard` with OS-level exception handling and `pyperclip` fallback to prevent rare Windows clipboard locking errors.
  - **Full Skill State Preservation:** Expanded default profile tracking to include *Smithing*, *Herblore*, and *Cooking* levels alongside *Crafting*, *Fletching*, and *Magic*, ensuring multi-skill configurations persist across restarts and account switches.
  - **Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts:** Bound `Esc` across all search inputs to instantly reset filters.

- **💰 Brand New "Craft & Sell GE" Tab (v1.3.30):**
  - **Pure Grand Exchange Production Moneymaking:** A completely dedicated production moneymaking tab featuring over 120 verified recipes across **Herblore, Crafting, Fletching, Smithing, Cooking, and Magic**. Buy raw ingredients on the Grand Exchange, process them, and sell the finished items directly on the GE for pure gold profit!
  - **📂 Expandable Ingredient Rows (`▶` / `▼` Dropdown):** Click the arrow or double-click any product (e.g. *Rune pickaxe*, *Prayer potion(3)*, *Air battlestaff*) to expand its raw material breakdown directly underneath it.
  - **🎯 Exact GE Bid & Ask Pricing with 1-Click Copy:**
    - Parent finished items display Total Material Cost at Bid vs Ask, Net GE Sell Price (with 1% OSRS tax deducted), Profit ea, ROI %, 4h Limit, Batch Profit, and GP/Hr.
    - Expanded ingredient rows display their exact **Target Offer (Bid)**, **Instant Buy (Ask)**, and **🎯 Best Buy Ceiling** (the maximum price you can pay for that raw material on the GE to guarantee profit!).
    - Clicking any price cell instantly copies the number directly to your clipboard for instant GE order placement.

- **🌐 Universal Search Across ALL Tabs & 57 New Recipes (v1.3.29):**

  - **Dual Field Sync:** Typing in either the global search bar or the Craft & Alch search bar instantly keeps both fields in sync.
  - **Material & Ingredient Search:** Search recipes not just by finished item name, but also by component materials (e.g. typing `mithril bar`, `yew logs`, `cosmic rune`, or `ruby` instantly shows all relevant crafts).
  - **Non-Intrusive Ctrl+F:** Pressing `Ctrl+F` focuses the search bar on whichever tab you are currently viewing without jarringly switching tabs. Pressing `Esc` clears all filters instantly.

Iron platebody now properly covers Level 33➔48 (until Steel platebodies unlock at 48).
  - **Fletching Bow Tiers Corrected:** Split Oak bows into **Oak shortbow** (Level 20) and **Oak longbow** (Level 25); updated **Willow longbow** to its true Level 40 requirement.
